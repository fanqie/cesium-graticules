================

This is a repository for useful small add ons to Cesium. Those add-ons can be viewed live at http://pad.geocento.com/AddOns

Currently it includes:
- Graticule, a display of a lat long grid over the Cesium globe which changes with the current view port. It has a few known issues when tilting the view.
- InfoWindow, a simple info window popup displayed at a lat long position over the globe.
